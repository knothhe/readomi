# Setting up Readomi with an agent

This guide is written for a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or similar)
acting on behalf of a person who uses this extension. The settings page
also supports manual service configuration and local configuration backups.
This optional agent flow uses a small JSON document that you produce,
verify against the real API, and place on the person's clipboard. The person pastes it into the settings page, checks a
preview and applies it.

Readomi runs entirely in the browser. It has no server and no account. Page
text goes straight from the browser to the service you configure here, in
the request shape that service documents. There is no SDK in between: the
request body you verify with `curl` is the body Readomi sends, plus the
prompt.

## What to do

1. **Ask** the person two things: which service they want to use, and where
   their API key is (a file, an environment variable, or they paste it to
   you).
2. **Keep the key out of your output.** Read it into a shell variable and
   never print it. Every command below assumes `KEY` holds it:

   ```bash
   KEY=$(cat ~/.secrets/deepseek)          # or: KEY="$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
   ```

3. **Verify** with the request template for the service, using the model and
   the `body` fields you intend to configure. If the service rejects the
   request, change the model or drop the field it rejects and try again,
   until a request succeeds.
4. **Write the document to the clipboard** with `jq`, so the key never appears
   in your output:

   ```bash
   jq -n --arg k "$KEY" '{
     type: "deepseek", apiKey: $k, model: "deepseek-flash",
     body: { thinking: { type: "disabled" } }
   }' | pbcopy          # macOS. Linux: wl-copy or xclip -selection clipboard. Windows: clip
   ```

5. **Tell the person**: open Readomi's settings page, paste into the box in
   the "Translation service" section (if a service is already set up, click
   "Edit" there first), and click "Apply". Readomi shows what will change,
   including the host that page text will be sent to, sends one short request
   to confirm, and saves the service only when that request works. Then it
   clears the clipboard. If the confirmation fails, nothing is saved and the
   person will paste the error text back to you.

To change an existing configuration, ask the person to click “Copy
instructions for your agent” in the "Translation service" section and paste
it to you; the text ends with the current document. The key in it is masked
(`sk-…a9f2`). Return the document with the masked key unchanged and Readomi
keeps the stored key; only a new key needs the clipboard step above.

## The document

The document describes the translation service and nothing else. The
languages, the display mode and the translation prompt are the person's own
settings in Readomi. The JSON Schema is at
[`schema/readomi-setup.schema.json`](../schema/readomi-setup.schema.json).
Unknown fields are rejected, so the person sees the error instead of a
silently ignored setting.

```json
{
  "type": "openai",
  "apiKey": "sk-…",
  "model": "gpt-6-luna",
  "body": { "reasoning": { "effort": "none" } }
}
```

| Field                  | Required                | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `type`        | yes                     | `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, or `openai-compatible` for any other endpoint that speaks the OpenAI chat completions API (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, Qwen, GLM, Moonshot, MiniMax, Doubao, gateways).                                                                                  |
| `api`         | no                      | Wire format: `openai-chat`, `openai-responses`, `anthropic` or `gemini`. Defaults from `type`: `openai` → `openai-responses`, `anthropic` → `anthropic`, `gemini` → `gemini`, `deepseek` and `openai-compatible` → `openai-chat`. Set `openai-responses` for a compatible service that speaks the Responses API, such as xAI. |
| `apiKey`      | for a new service       | The key. Endpoints without authentication still need a non-empty value such as `"local"`. A masked value from an export keeps the stored key.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `baseURL`     | for `openai-compatible` | Base URL up to and including the version path, e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1`. Omit for an official API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `name`        | no                      | Display name.

| `body`        | no                      | JSON merged into every request body, exactly as the API documents it. Objects merge key by key; anything else replaces Readomi's value. See the recipes.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `temperature` | no                      | Sampling temperature. Sent only when set.

A document replaces the stored service with the same `type` and `baseURL`,
or adds a new one. Other services and every other setting stay as they are.
When the person wants a different model or option, they hand you the current
configuration and you return the changed document; they may also edit a
field in place on the settings page.

## Recipes

Translation needs fast answers, so turn thinking off or down where the model
has it. The `body` values below are the fields from each service's own API
reference; check the reference when a model is newer than this guide.

| Service                                                                   | `type`              | `model`                        | `body`                                                                         | Notes                                                                                                                                                      |

| OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, Qwen, GLM, Moonshot, MiniMax, Doubao, gateways | `openai-compatible` | as the service names it        | `{ "reasoning_effort": "none" }` if it accepts it                              | `baseURL` from the service's docs, ending in its version path. Some services reject `reasoning_effort: "none"` with `Invalid option: expected one of "low" | …`; drop the field then. |

## Verification templates

Use the shortest possible input. One successful response is enough. Each
template is the request Readomi sends, without the translation prompt.

**OpenAI** (Responses API):

```bash
curl -sS https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-6-luna","input":"Translate to Simplified Chinese: Hello","reasoning":{"effort":"none"}}'
```

**Anthropic** (Messages API; `max_tokens` is required, Readomi sends 8192):

```bash
curl -sS https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $KEY" -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-haiku-4-5","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Translate to Simplified Chinese: Hello"}],"thinking":{"type":"disabled"}}'
```

**Gemini** (`generateContent`; the model is part of the path):

```bash
curl -sS "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-3.5-flash-lite:generateContent" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contents":[{"role":"user","parts":[{"text":"Translate to Simplified Chinese: Hello"}]}],"generationConfig":{"thinkingConfig":{"thinkingLevel":"minimal"}}}'
```

**DeepSeek and every OpenAI-compatible service** (chat completions at
`baseURL`; DeepSeek's `baseURL` is `https://api.deepseek.com`):

```bash
curl -sS "$BASE_URL/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Translate to Simplified Chinese: Hello"}],"thinking":{"type":"disabled"}}'
```

A `200` with a non-empty answer means the configuration works. A `400` or
`422` that names a field means the model does not accept it: remove it from
`body` and try again. A `401` means the key is wrong; a `404` on
`openai-compatible` usually means `baseURL` is missing its version path.

## Opening Readomi

Click Readomi's toolbar icon and open Settings → Translation service.
This section is `options.html#service` inside the installed extension; the
extension ID differs from upstream and between browsers. Do not put the
document into a URL: browsers keep full URLs, including the fragment, in history.
