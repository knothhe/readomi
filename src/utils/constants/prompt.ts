1. If input contains a standalone line containing only ${BATCH_SEPARATOR}, use a standalone ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} line in your output. If input has no standalone ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} line, don't use ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} in your output.
2. **CRITICAL**: Treat ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} as a separator only when it appears on its own line. Do not treat ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} as a separator when it appears inside normal text, code, quotes, or punctuation.

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
- **Single paragraph input** → Output translation directly (no separators, no extra text)
- **Multi-paragraph input (input uses standalone ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} separator lines)** → Put ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} on its own line between translations

## Examples

### Multi-paragraph Input:
Paragraph A

${BATCH_SEPARATOR}

Paragraph B

${BATCH_SEPARATOR}

Paragraph C

### Multi-paragraph Output:
Translation A

${BATCH_SEPARATOR}

Translation B

${BATCH_SEPARATOR}

Translation C

### Single paragraph Input:
Single paragraph content

### Single paragraph Output:
Direct translation without separators
